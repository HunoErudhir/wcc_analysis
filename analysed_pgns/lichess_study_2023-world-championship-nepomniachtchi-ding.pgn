On the plus side, by avoiding the most forcing lines (which Nepo will surely have analysed in depth) Ding at least guarantees a 'game'.

The current configuration makes kingside play less likely for white (at least in the short term) but there are some new ideas involving Bxc6 and the structures arising from that. In general these 'Carlsbad' structures are quite rich and white has been finding ways in recent years to put the black position under pressure. It is funny that the players are again contesting a Carlsbad (see game 3) - although they have different colours they actually have the same version of the structure they had from that previous game. } 11.

Bf1 Nd7?! { Seems like a dubious play, but played quickly by Nepo. immediately criticised by Giri. Possibly Nepo isn't so familiar with these positions (certainly he doesn't play the Caro for example) but again this is quite typical for Nepo playing very directly.
